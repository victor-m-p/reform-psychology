## for querries generally
(1) very important to have "open science" rather than without quotes to get specific search rather than "open AND science" (unless that is intended)
(2) run_multiple_twarc.sh: for running multiple queries (relies on the .txt files and the 'twarc2 searches' functionality)
(3) run_single_twarc.sh: for running single query (relies on input and the 'twarc2 search' functionality)
(4) start_date = 2007-01-01, end_date = 2022-01-01

## semantic kernel / preprocessing 
(1) semantic kernel too little data for e.g. bropenscience
(2) seems like we still have some stop-words.
